Are you ready to dive into the technical details of our amazing Christmas demo? Great! Here's how to download the source code and compile the rust program using git and cargo:

First, make sure you have git and the Rust programming language installed on your system. You can find installation instructions at https://git-scm.com/ and https://www.rust-lang.org/.

Also, make sure you have Cmake installed. In Linux, you need to have the development libraries for SDL2 and ALSA.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to download the source code.

Run the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:

$ git clone https://github.com/idaho06/akinoxmas2022.rust.git

Change into the newly created christmas-demo directory:

$ cd akinoxmas2022.rust

Run the following command to build and run the rust program using cargo:

$ cargo run --release

And that's it! You should now have the AkinoSoft Christmas demo running on your system. Happy hacking!
